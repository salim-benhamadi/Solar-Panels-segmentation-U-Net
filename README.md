The Solar-Panels-Segmentation-U-Net project is a Python notebook (.ipynb) that focuses on segmenting solar panels from aerial imagery using the U-Net architecture. It aims to assist in the identification and analysis of solar panel installations from satellite or drone images.

## üì∑ Project Overview

Solar energy is an increasingly popular and renewable energy source. The project aims to automate the process of identifying and segmenting solar panels within images, enabling efficient analysis, monitoring, and assessment of solar energy installations.

The U-Net architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN), is employed for semantic segmentation tasks. By leveraging U-Net, the project achieves accurate solar panel segmentation by differentiating them from the surrounding structures and backgrounds.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `Solar_Panels_Segmentation_U_Net.ipynb`: This Python notebook is the main project file. It contains the implementation of the U-Net architecture for solar panel segmentation, along with detailed explanations, code comments, and visualizations.

- `data/`: This directory contains sample data for testing and demonstration purposes. It includes aerial imagery with solar panels and their corresponding ground truth masks.

- `results/`: This directory will be automatically generated when running the notebook. It stores the segmented solar panel masks and any intermediate results or visualizations.

- `README.md`: The README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running and contributing to it.
